##  Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your WhatsApp AI Chatbot locally or deploy it to a server.

### üìã Prerequisites

-  Python 3.8+
-  Google Gemini API Key ([Get it here](https://cloud.google.com/gemini))
-  Twilio Account & WhatsApp API Credentials ([Sign up here](https://www.twilio.com))
-  ngrok (for local testing) or a server for production

###  Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purendeeswar24/WhatsApp-AI-Chatbot-Conversational-AI-using-Google-Gemini-Twilio.git
   cd WhatsApp-AI-Chatbot-Conversational-AI-using-Google-Gemini-Twilio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=your_twilio_whatsapp_number
   ```

4. **Run the Flask App Locally**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Expose Your Local Server with ngrok**  
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
   Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io`) and configure it as the webhook in your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox.

6. **Test the Chatbot**  
   Send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number and watch the AI respond! 

---

##  Deployment

For production, deploy the Flask app to a cloud platform like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud**. Update the Twilio webhook with your production URL.

---

##  Customization

- **Prompt Engineering**: Modify the prompts in `app.py` to tailor the AI‚Äôs tone and responses.
- **Session Management**: Enable session-aware conversations by storing chat history (see `session.py`).
- **Use Cases**: Extend functionality for e-commerce, FAQs, or niche applications.

### Summary of Workflow:
- 1. The chatbot operates through a streamlined workflow:
- 2. A user sends a message via WhatsApp to a Twilio-registered number.
- 3. Twilio captures the message and forwards it as an HTTPS POST request to the Flask application's webhook endpoint.
- 4. During development, ngrok exposes the local Flask server to the internet, providing a public URL for Twilio.
- 5. The Flask application processes the incoming message, extracts content, and sends it to the Google Gemini API for response generation.
- 6. Gemini, authenticated via a secure API key stored in a .env file, generates a context-aware response.
- 7. The Flask application formats the response for WhatsApp compatibility and sends it back to Twilio.
- 8. Twilio delivers the response to the user, completing the interaction cycle.

- This architecture ensures real-time, intelligent conversations with minimal latency, leveraging modular components for scalability and ease of maintenance.
  
### Main Advantages
- **Accessibility**: Operates within WhatsApp, a platform with over 2 billion users, requiring no additional software or learning curve.
- **Intelligent Responses**: Powered by Google Gemini, the chatbot delivers coherent, context-aware, and human-like replies, enhancing user engagement.
- **Scalability**: The modular design allows easy updates, such as swapping AI models or deploying to cloud platforms, to handle large user bases.
- **Cost-Effective Development**: Utilizes free-tier Gemini API access and ngrok for local testing, reducing initial costs.
- **Versatility**: Supports diverse use cases, from casual conversations to appointment scheduling, with customizable prompts and logic.
- **Security**: Environment variables and secure webhook communication ensure sensitive data protection.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Twilio's robust API and Gemini's low-latency processing enable instant responses, mimicking human conversation flow.
